Algorithms Problem 3 

ask the user to enter first no./
Get the operator from the user
Ask the user to add 2nd no.
If operator= "+" result=number1+number2
elseif operator from user ="-" result=numb1-numb2
elseif operator="*" . result=numb1*numb2
elseif operator="/" . result=numb1/numb2
else if operator="%" .handle modulus by 0 if no. 2 =0, error occur
else: error:Invalid operator


pseudo code
1- Start
2- Input no. 1
 input no. 3
input no.5
3- Set multiplication=0
4-multiply 1 with1,3 with 1, 5 with1
By comparing multiplication we find out that 5>3>1
5- Print 5 is greater 
6- End
