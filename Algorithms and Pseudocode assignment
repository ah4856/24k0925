Algorithms Problem 1:Implement an algorithm for making an calculator with all operator(+,-,*,%,/). 

ask the user to enter first no./
Get the operator from the user
Ask the user to add 2nd no.
If operator= "+" result=number1+number2
elseif operator from user ="-" result=numb1-numb2
elseif operator="*" . result=numb1*numb2
elseif operator="/" . result=numb1/numb2
else if operator="%" .handle modulus by 0 if no. 2 =0, error occur
else: error:Invalid operator


PSEUDOCODE 1: finf out the largest number from three variable .
1- Start
2- Input no. 1
 input no. 3
input no.5
3- Set multiplication=0
4-multiply 1 with1,3 with 1, 5 with1
By comparing multiplication we find out that 5>3>1
5- Print 5 is greater 
6- End
PSEUDOCODE 2:Takethree variables as input and add them without using the + operator(use your head for this)
1:Start
2:Input variable 2
3"Input variable 4
4:Input variable 6
5:Set subtaction to 0
6:Multiply 2nd and 3rd input with (-1) so result=2,-4,-6
7:Set subtraction to numbers : 2-(-4)-(-6)
8:Else the sum=12
9:Print the sum=12
10:End
PSEUDOCODE3:Create a small calculator which only does '+','-' operation (Take three variables as input with
one being used for operator)
1:Start :
2:Declare variable
3:Input num 1 as variable 
4:Input num 2
5:Get the operator 
6:Declare result as integers 
7:enter thefirst number : num1
8:Enter the operator (+,-) : Input operator
9:Enter the 2nd number : input num 2
10:Perform calculation based on operator 
11:If operator is "+" then
12:Set result=num1+num2
13:If operator is"-" then
14:Set result=num1-num2
15:Elseif operator is different from '+','-'
16:Print "invalid operator"
17:Output the result,Print "The resultis:"result"
End
ALGORITHM 2:implement an algorithm where user enters a number, and an operator month is displayed .
1:Ask the user to enter the number
2:If the number entered is 1 then it is January
3:If the number entered is 2 then it is February
4:If the number is 3 then it is March
5:If the number is 4 then it is april
6:IF the number is 5 then it is May
7:if the number is 6 then it is june 
8:If the number is 7 then it is July 
9:If the number is 8 then it is august
10:if the number is 9 then it is september
11:If the number is 10 then it is october
12:If the nummber is 11 then it is Noveber
13:If the number is 12 then it is December
14:Else the range is not between 1 to 12 than Displayed not Valid
ALGORITHM 3:implement an algorithm for determining f Nth is a devisor of n number i.e:(2 is divisor of 6).Determine if 
its even or odd
1:Ask the user to enter Nth which is divisor of n number ,and determine if N is even or odd
2:Check if Nth is divisor of n number by checking remainder
3:When n is divided by N is 0 i.e;n%N==0
4:Determine if N is even or odd
5:If N%2==0 then N is even 
6:If N/2 is not equal to 0 then it is odd
7:If Nis divisor of n then print it
8:Else:Print If N is not divisor of{n}
